5.Only one DesiredCapability deviceName should be changed to the name of real device (you can get this name by running adb devices in CLI)  
For example in my case: capabilities.setCapability("deviceName","682da8c20504");

6.Steps:
1.install driver which suits your device (via Internet)
2.turn on the developer mode on physical device and enable USB debugging
3.connect device to via USB

Run Appium server and run tests.

I had to use another version of Chrome in appium, because of elder version on emulator.On my PC emulator works much slower because there is not much ORM.
So, on real device tests works much faster and before tests every time appium settings window appears.
Also,with web test on real device appears windows containing choode searching system options.
