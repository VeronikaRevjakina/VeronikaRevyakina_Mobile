1.Yes, it did after removing status checking , with it was UnsupportedCommandException.
3.Yes, it did with pre-installed app on device and with usage of udid in properties(deviceName wasnt working).
4.No, because with native test on epam cloud required appPackage and appActivity. Test falls with : org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: Unable to create a new remote session. 
Please check the server log for more details. Original error: {"status":13,"value":{"message":
"An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. Original error: 
The desired capabilities must include either an app, appPackage or browserName"},"sessionId":null} 
8. I can think of using PageObject pattern, but because f lack of locators it is not appropriate in our case.
Also we can use JSON which is better way to store capabilities, but in order of lack of them in our case it would have been
just overhead and inappropriate use of patterns.
